# Attendance List Smart Contract

## Project Title
Attendance List

## Project Description
This project implements a simple decentralized attendance list where organizers can track attendees for events or classes immutably on the Aptos blockchain. It allows organizers to mark their presence and retrieve the list of attendees via smart contract functions.

## Vision
To create a tamper-proof, immutable record of attendance for events, meetings, or classes that is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain. This ensures that attendance tracking is trustless and decentralized.

## Key Features
- **Create Attendance List**: Organizers can create a new attendance list for their event.
- **Mark Attendance**: Attendees can mark their attendance for an event immutably on the blockchain.
- **Retrieve Attendance List**: Organizers can retrieve the list of attendees for an event.

## Future Scope
- **Event Management**: Add features for event creation and management, such as setting event details, start and end times, and limiting attendance.
- **Attendee Verification**: Include functionality to verify the identity of attendees before marking attendance.
- **Rewards for Attendees**: Add incentives for participants by distributing tokens or rewards based on attendance.
- **Integration with dApps**: Provide API integration for decentralized applications to use the attendance data.
- **Attendance Analytics**: Include analytics for attendance trends, participation rates, and more.
